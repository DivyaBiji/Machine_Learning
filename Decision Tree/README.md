### Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Dataset
This repository contains code that demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Algorithm to make predictions on the Iris dataset. The Decision Tree Algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python.

#### *Dataset*<br>
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks.

The dataset used in this project is provided in the iris.csv file. It contains the following columns:<br>

SepalLengthCm<br>
SepalWidthCm<br>
PetalLengthCm<br>
PetalWidthCm<br>
Species<br>
#### *Requirements*<br>
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:<br>

Python (version 3.6 or higher)<br>
pandas<br>
scikit-learn<br>
matplotlib<br>

#### *Usage*<br>
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.<br>

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.<br>

Run the decisiontree.py file using the Python interpreter:<br>
<br>
Copy code<br>
python decision_tree_classifier.py<br>
This will train a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset, visualize the resulting decision tree, and make predictions on a new data point.<br>

The predicted species for the new data point will be printed in the console.<br>

#### *Results*<br>
The code provided in this repository will train a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset and generate a visualization of the resulting decision tree. This visualization helps in understanding how the decision tree makes predictions based on different features.

You can also use the trained classifier to make predictions on new data points by providing the feature values as input.
